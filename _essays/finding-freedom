On days without money, and with no one to see, I would ride the public bus back and forth, station to station, and back again. I’d write, sometimes just listen. Other times I’d look out the window for whatever caught my interest, and no matter what I did, it was all the same. The bus was one place in the city where I felt I could simply exist. A space where it was accepted, even expected, that I was just there. A vessel of transience, people interchanging for reasons I’d never know. No one cared where I was going, and no one needed to. At the end of each route, to remain unnoticed even by the driver, I’d step off, wait, and catch the next bus back. Part of it all, invisible.

In the city, it’s the closest thing to the oak forest where I grew up. I’d walk for hours, or sit under a tree, completely surrounded by nature. it never counted the time. You can’t sit in a café for long without a purchase, and a park bench brings stares or questions. On the bus was freedom, not for the ability to go anywhere, but to unconditionally belong. To stay without question. To rest without reason. To be, without money, and with no one to see.
